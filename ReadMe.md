This exercise demonstrates Java programming inheritance. In this program, we create a base class called 'Animal' with a method named makeSound(). Then, you will create a subclass of 'Animal' called 'Cat' which inherits from 'Animal'. The 'Cat' class will override the makeSound() method and change it to make a quarrel sound.
